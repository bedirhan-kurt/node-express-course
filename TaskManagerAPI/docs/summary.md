# MERN Task Manager: Node.js Concepts Summary

## Project Overview

The MERN Task Manager is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js that allows users to manage tasks. The application follows modern Node.js development practices and demonstrates several important concepts and patterns.

## Key Files and Their Purpose

1. **app.js**: Main application entry point that sets up the Express server, middleware, and database connection
2. **models/Tasks.js**: Defines the Mongoose schema and model for tasks
3. **routes/tasks.js**: Defines the API routes using Express Router
4. **controllers/tasks.js**: Contains the controller functions for handling CRUD operations
5. **middleware/asyncWrapper.js**: Implements the AsyncWrapper pattern for error handling
6. **middleware/errorHandler.js**: Implements the error handling middleware
7. **middleware/notFound.js**: Implements middleware for handling 404 errors
8. **errors/customAPIError.js**: Defines a custom error class and factory function
9. **db/connect.js**: Handles the database connection

## Documentation Files

1. **nodejs_concepts.md**: A comprehensive list of Node.js and Express.js concepts used in the project
2. **pattern_explanations.md**: A deep dive into the AsyncWrapper pattern and Error Handling mechanism

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a well-structured Node.js/Express.js application with proper separation of concerns, error handling, and RESTful API design. It uses modern JavaScript features like async/await and follows best practices for Node.js development.

The project is an excellent learning resource for understanding how to build robust Node.js applications with proper error handling and code organization.
